# Codility-Lessons
I started solving the codility challenges to improve my Python Skills

In data science, we import packages to ingest, wrangle and analyze the datasets with Python. Modules like Pandas, Numpy,Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Keras makes our tasks very easy.

To know Python or create a software product, we need to know the different algorithms. 

I started solving Python problems in Leetcode and Codility in order to become a Python expert.
